<h2>About the project</h2>
<p> 
The concept of fingerprint recognition has long existed, with extensive use for privacy in phones,  employee/student attendance,etc. However, this requires a special Sensor to register the fingerprint. This can have some disadvantages like :
</p>
<ul>
<li>Malfunction of sensor due to improper usage, like applying excess pressure </li>
<li>Spread of direct contact diseases among users</li>
<li>Reduced privacy due to imprint of finger on the sensor </li>
</ul>
<p>
In order to tackle these issues, the idea of Fingerprint recognition has to work without any contact, which is our aim of this project. 
We intend to capture a real time image of the user’s finger and extract the features of the fingerprint ( same as it would generate using a sensor ). We then perform fingerprint recognition using machine learning techniques. Each persons’ fingerprints  are associated to a unique ID, using which identification occurs.
